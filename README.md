# Animation with tkinter

This is a simple Python script that displays an animation using tkinter, a Python GUI library, and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

The animation consists of a series of frames contained in a GIF file. The script loads the file, extracts each frame and displays them in a label widget. The script then cycles through the frames at a specified time interval to give the appearance of an animation.
